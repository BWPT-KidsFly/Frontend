## Tech Stack
React | Redux | ReactRouter V4 | Netlify | Formik | Yup | Axios | JWT | Material UI | Styled-Componenets
### Front end built using:

#### 1️⃣ [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-v16.13.1-blue.svg)

-    Declarative --Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
-    Component-Based --Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
-    Learn Once, Write Anywhere --You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code

#### 2️⃣ [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) ![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-v4.0.5-blueviolet.svg)
 
-   Single immutable state tree
-   Ease of Testing
-   Global Store of App State

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/BWPT-KidsFly/Backend) built using:

#### 1️⃣ [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/) ![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/express-v4.17.1-lightgrey.svg)

-    Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).
-    Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code.
-    The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.

#### 2️⃣ [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/pg-v8.2.1-blue.svg)

-    Implements the SQL standard very well.
-    Completely open source.
-    It supports lots of advanced data types, such as (multi-dimensional) arrays, user-defined types, etc.


# APIs
## 1️⃣ https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/keys
#### You'll need to register with rapidapi to get a user key.
- Its free to signup with rapidapi and they have thousands of apis you can test and access on their platform.
- Read the documentation for any apis that you register a secondary key. 
### Most are free, some are freemium.
- You might need a credit card to register in case the api is abused or accessed milions of times in a row.
 
 #### An example rate is 
- free access to the first 500 attempted calls from your verifed IP address to the" Airline Server" per day
- then $.01 per call for any calls after 30 in an hour
- Verify this before making any backend endpoint calls


## 2️⃣ https://skyscanner-skyscanner-flight-search-v1.p.rapidapi.com/
The API gives users access to the site's data making it available for use in third party web sites and applications. 
This data includes: airport locations, Abbreviations, flight departure and arrival times, flight availablity etc.
The API uses HTTP calls and responses are formatted in XML, JSON and PHP.


## 3️⃣ BOM Browser Object Model & geolocation api 
  This api integrates with the skyscanner-flight-search allowing the user to find and store their home airport by latitude and longitude coordinates available through the current browser session on the user's device. 

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables; 
Either in their local path
- on the path of the container
- image spun up
- accessible through a custom 3rd party server
- or in a .env file at the root of the project

The .env file could contain the following ( no spaces | no <>'s | no "quotes" ):
REACT_APP_RAPID_API_:<the url of the skyscanner most recent endpoint>
REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY:<your registered access key with rapidapi platform>


# Testing

## 1️⃣ [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) ![Jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/jest-v4.2.4-red.svg)
-   Jest is a JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!


# Installation Instructions

* Clone this repo
* run `yarn install` to install all required dependencies
* run `yarn start` to start the local server


## Other Scripts

* start - ***"react-scripts start",*** starts the production server after a build is created
* build - ***"react-scripts build",*** creates a build of the application
* test - ***"react-scripts test",*** runs tests in **tests** directory
* eject - ***"react-scripts eject",*** copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
* coverage - ***"CI=true yarn test --coverage --watchAll=false || true"*** refers to how much of your app code is covered by unit tests
