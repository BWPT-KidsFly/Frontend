KidsFly

Any parent who has ever traveled solo with multiple children in tow know the struggle all too well - 
balancing a squirming baby in one arm a while also juggling your own luggage, the diaper bag, the toddler's luggage, 
the carseat, the stroller, your boarding passes, everyone's passports in the other, all while trying to keep tabs on multiple 
children's orbits in a sea of unfamiliar people. It can be physically and mentally exhausting and turn the most exciting vacation 
plans into a living nightmare. The good news is that with KidsFly, you'll never dread another trip to the airport. 
KidsFly is an app that alerts one our fully-vetted "KidsFlyConnect" staff of your estimated arrival so that someone will be 
waiting for you curbside when you arrive - flight details, luggage type and quantity, number of passengers and any special needs are 
just a few examples of information you can provide pre-arrival to your KidsFlyConnection using our simple, 
intuitive mobile app, so that we can curate the most pleasant check-in and boarding experience possible.
